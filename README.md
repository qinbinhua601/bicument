## Introduction

bicument is a project for easily building, deploying, and maintaining open source project websites, inherited and enhanced from Docusaurus.

- **Simple to Start** bicument is built to be easy to [get up and running](https://github.com/shuangwhywhy/bicument) in as little time possible. We've built bicument to handle the website build process so you can focus on your project.
- **Customizable** While bicument ships with the key pages and sections you need to get started, including a home page, a docs section, a [blog](https://github.com/shuangwhywhy/bicument), and additional support pages, it is also [customizable](https://github.com/shuangwhywhy/bicument) as well to ensure you have a site that is [uniquely yours](https://github.com/shuangwhywhy/bicument).

## Installation

bicument is available as the [`bicument` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bicument) on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com).

## Contributing

We've released bicument because it helps us better scale and support the many OSS projects at bilibili. We hope that other organizations can benefit from the project. We are thankful for any contributions from the community.
